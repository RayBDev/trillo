  Trillo
</h1>

Trillo is a travel review and booking application focused on hotels, flights, car rentals, and tours. 
This website is a design concept of what the app will look like but functionality has not yet been included.
Future planning includes API and backend integration to take this website from design to functional SPA.

## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **HTML5 & CSS3**

    This website makes heavy use of HTML5 semantic elements along with BEM CSS3 naming convention.
    It showcases the power of flexbox which is used throughout the design and floats were avoided all together.

2.  **SASS**

    Sass was used to keep the CSS3 code organized, scalable, and maintainable.

3.  **React + Gatsby**

    Future plans are to build functionality into this design and therefore React and Gatsby were used as the framework.
